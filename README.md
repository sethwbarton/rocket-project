# rocket-project

This was the original goal: 
Model rocketry on a serious level, supported by mobile apps, a web server, and web page.

I didn't end up writing any code for this idea. If you'd like to take it up, be my guest. You can see all the wonderful ideas I had within this repository as all I 
ended up getting around to was defining some of the things I wanted it to do. I was really thinking of an entire system. You might say it never *got off the ground*.
I'm sorry.
